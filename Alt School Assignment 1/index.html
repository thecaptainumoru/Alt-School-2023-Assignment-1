        <h2>Why I Joined AltSchool</h2>
        <p>I joined AltSchool because I saw an opportunity to learn the ropes of Cloud Engineering for cheaps. </br><br>I sensed that the course may not come at this price again; so I decided to give it my all and enroll for the Cloud Engineering path.</p>

        <h2>What I Plan to Achieve with Alt School</h2>
        <p>Gain the requisite skills to land a remote role as a cloud engineer. <br> That's the long and short of it. No long story there.</p>
